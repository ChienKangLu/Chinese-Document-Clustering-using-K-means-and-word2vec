# Chinese-Document-Clustering-using-K-means-and-word2vec
Document Clustering is a method for finding structure within a collection of documents, so that similar documents can be grouped into categories. This is an Unsupervised grouping of text documents into meaningful groups, usually representing topics in the document collection

## Difficulties
+ Unstructured data: Document is composed by words 
+ How to capture the semantic in the document
+ How to encode the document: Let computer can process them
+ Chinese word is different from English: Maybe two or three words concatenate together be the smallest semantic unit
